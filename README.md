total: 12 hours 15 minutes.

Missing elements:

Send and receive:

message doesn't consist of message date

Push-functionality:
Nothing is implemented

Reasoning for missing functionality:
Sadly i did not have enough time to implement everything within the timeframe that i initially set for myself. I ended up getting sick for a few days where i wanted to spend most of the day on the project and then i had to do school related work on top of this assignment and also volunteer work.

Furthermore, there was alot of the things i needed to learn which has been great. I now understand how to query in firestore and how firebase auth works. I've also learned more about configuring for android specifically. So overall a really awesome exercise.
